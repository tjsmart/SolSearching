SOME NOTES ABOUT VARSPEEDSERVO

attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
default min is 544, max is 2400  

write(value)     - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
write(value, speed) - speed varies the speed of the move to new position 0=full speed, 1-255 slower to faster
write(value, speed, wait) - wait is a boolean that, if true, causes the function call to block until move is complete

writeMicroseconds() - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds 
read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180. 
readMicroseconds()  - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. (was read_us() in first release)
attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached. 
detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin. 

slowmove(value, speed) - The same as write(value, speed), retained for compatibility with Korman's version

stop() - stops the servo at the current position

sequencePlay(sequence, sequencePositions); // play a looping sequence starting at position 0
sequencePlay(sequence, sequencePositions, loop, startPosition); // play sequence with number of positions, loop if true, start at position
sequenceStop(); // stop sequence at current position
wait(); // wait for movement to finish
isMoving()  // return true if servo is still moving
